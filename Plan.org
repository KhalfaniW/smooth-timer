This is a timer app that slows down when viewed

The goal is to modify percieved effort of activities




** ideas
  - hide unless hover
  - slow when shown
  - slow even more
  - make checkpoints
** now
  + [ ] setup basic test
    + [ ] setup playwright
    + [ ] wait 0.1 sec and display value increases





** bug
**** files need to be jsx
****** problem

****** solution (quick fix)
     make input file named jsx instead of js

     
**** (ai) hooks library is deperecated

A Note about React 18 Support
As part of the changes for React 18, it has been decided that the renderHook API provided by this library will instead be included as official additions to both react-testing-library (PR) and react-native-testing-library (PR) with the intention being to provide a more cohesive and consistent implementation for our users.

Please be patient as we finalise these changes in the respective testing libraries. In the mean time you can install @testing-library/react@^13.1
